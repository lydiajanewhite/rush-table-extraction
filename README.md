# rush-table-extraction
extracting and summarising species abundance data for response diversity meta analysis database

manually removed blank rows that were a result of errors in figure data extraction 
manually edited sd NAs for study 2629 lady beetle - checked against original data set in paper 

for handful of studies (1042, 1334, 179, 452, 809) pivoting data from wide to long format resulted in NAs, so convert these to zeros in import scripts, after verifying in original papers that they should be zeros.
