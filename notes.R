NAs and zeros for sd a problem -> cannot compute hedges g 
some NAs are real, becuse the mean is zero
some times the error is zero from extracting graphs from figures i.e. resolution is poor so error is minimal
some studies the error should be zero but is just very small becasue of clicking on graph. 
some studies there is no error given 
sometimes complicated to know if its a zero of a NA 


if n = 1 then s = NaN, so g =  NaN
if mean & SD for contol & SD treatment = zero then s = 0 and g = Inf or NaN
if SD contol AND SD treatment = zero then s = 0 and g = Inf or NaN
if only one SD (contol or treatment) = zero then its fine 
if only one mean (contol or treatment) = zero then its fine
if only one mean and SD (contol or treatment) = zero then its fine
